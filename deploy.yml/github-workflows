Your project needs to be built into simple web files (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Think of these as the finished pieces of your project.
Put all these finished pieces into a special folder. We'll call this folder docs for now, but you can change it if you need to.
deploy.yml 
.github/workflows.
Step 3: What the "Deploy" Helper Does

When you make changes to your project and "push" them to GitHub (like saving your work online), the "deploy" helper will:
Check out your code: It grabs a copy of your project.
(Optional) Build your project: If your project needs to be built first (like compiling code), the helper can do that. We've included some lines in the deploy.yml file that you can "uncomment" (remove the # in front of them) if you need this step.
Put it on GitHub Pages: It takes your finished project files from the docs folder and puts them online at a special address like https://gdub662.github.io.
Step 4: Your Project's Homepage
We'll include a simple index.html file in your docs folder. This is like a "placeholder" homepage.
Important: You'll replace ththis file with the actual main page of your project!
Step 5: How Others Can Find It (README.md)
We'll update a file called README.md in your project. This file is like a quick guide for anyone looking at your project.
It will tell them that your project is live at https://gdub662.github.io and explain how it all works.
